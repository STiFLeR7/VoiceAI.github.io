# NanoAssistant
NanoAssistant is a simple voice assistant developed using Python. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API for language understanding and response generation, SoundDevice for recording audio, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Listens to user's voice commands and transcribes them to text.
- **AI Conversation**: Communicates with users in natural language using OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the assistant's text responses into voice and speaks them out.
